## Topics

To get a feel for what we are interested in hearing about, here is the programme for the past years ([2009](http://jsconf.eu/2009/speakers.html), [2010](http://jsconf.eu/2010/speakers.html), [2011](http://jsconf.eu/2011/speakers.html), [2012](http://2012.jsconf.eu/speakers.html), [2013](http://2013.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2014](http://2014.jsconf.eu/speakers/), [2015](http://2015.jsconf.eu/speakers/)).

We like to see anything that squarely fits into the spectrum of:

 * Cutting-edge technological advances in the world of JavaScript or computer science in general, if somehow applicable to JavaScript.
 * Wild Ideas & Clever Hacks.
 * Improving JavaScript developers’ lives.
 * Mobile JS.
 * Embedded JS.
 * Hardware JS.
 * Fundamentals, in a modern light.
 * The JavaScript community, culture, history, past, present & future, the why the who and the what of what we’re all doing.
 * And finally: Whatever the hell you want; this is your conference.
