## We can help

Not everybody is a natural talent on stage. Not everybody can produce kick-ass slide-decks. Not everybody is a live-demo-god. Not everybody knows they have something great to talk about.

There are about a million reasons why *you* don’t consider yourself a speaker, let alone at JSConf EU, where all your heroes have spoken in the past. **We are here to prove you wrong**. If all you have is a gut feeling that you should be on stage, we are here to help you to develop or hone the skills you think you lack to deliver a great presentation.

* We are happy to brainstorm your interests to see if a great topic is hiding.
* We are happy to connect you with experienced speakers to help prepare your submission, or you can refer to the “Example Submission” section below for tips.
* We are happy to review and advise on how to produce a slide deck. If you don't feel creative, just use our [Keynote or PowerPoint](https://github.com/jsconf/presentation-templates/downloads) templates.
 * If you need practice giving talks, get in touch, we can hook you up with local groups or set up a stage for you and a bunch of friends in advance, so you can practice in front of a friendly crowd.
 * Again, *whatever* else you might need, we’re here to help.

Get in touch: [contact@jsconf.eu](mailto:contact@jsconf.eu ) (just don’t use this to submit a proposal).

If you need more encouragement, check out co-organiser Tiffany’s site [We Are All Awesome](http://weareallaweso.me/) that tries to convince you to speak.
